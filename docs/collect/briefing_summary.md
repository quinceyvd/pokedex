In this briefing summary we'll discuss the requests and what we are going to do to make it happen

CORE TASKS
The core tasks of this project are to perfect the design of the web-application, to utilize a JavaScrip framework or library for an efficient development process and to ensure that the design is responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

API INTEGRATION
In this project we're going to use a Pokémon API as our primary soucre of information about the Pokémon. Information that we need to fetch are species, abilities, moves etc. and we need to display this information in a accessible manner.

DOCUMENTATION AND COLLABORATION
We need to document the codebase thoroughly, explaining the codes features so that back-enders and data engineers can understand the code and potentially integrate ther work with our project.

CREATIVE FREEDOM
We have creative control about the features, so we can make the project as we desire.

DELIVERABLES
1. A fully functional web-based Pokédex.
2. Source code with comprehensive documentation.
3. A brief report explaining your design choices and any innovative features you included.
